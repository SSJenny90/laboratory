Laboratory: A python-based program for controlling laboratory instruments and making electrical impedance measurements
==================================

Overview
========

Laboratory is a program designed to make electrical conductivity measurements of a rock sample at high temperatures through use of impedance spectroscopy and includes the calculation of CO/CO2 or H2/CO2 gas ratios for controlling oxygen fugacity.

The program was designed around the following instruments:

- Keysight E34972A LXI Data Acquisition / Data Logger Switch unit

- Keysight E4980A Precision LCR Meter, 20 Hz to MHz

- Eurotherm 3216 PID temperature controller

- Alicat Gas Mass Flow Controllers

- Optics Focus Motion Controller

*due to complications in our lab, the code remains very much untested and requires much improvement
