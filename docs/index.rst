Electrical Conductivity Laboratory
==========================================

Electrical Conductivity Laboratory is a program designed to measure the electrical conductivity of a rock sample at high temperatures under controlled oxygen fugcaity conditions

through use of impedance spectroscopy and includes calculation of CO/CO2 or H2/CO2 gas ratios for controlling oxygen fugacity.
