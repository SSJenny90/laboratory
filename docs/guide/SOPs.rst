Standard Operating Procedure
============================

Safety equipment
-----------------
It is strongly recommended that the following safety equipment be worn when using this laboratory:

- Closed in footwear
- Eye protection
- Lab coat

Gas competency training
------------------------
Following on from the safety considerations, it is a requirement of using this laboratory that you are assessed for competency in safely handling the gases that are available. This training must be conducted by an authorised person which will typically be one of the appointed University lab supervisors (see contact details on door of lab). Gas competency training must be renewed every 12 months and lodged with the School of Physical Sciences HSW administrators. Training will include but not be limited to:

- Gas isolation and flow regulation at the cylinder
- Gas isolation and flow regulation at the Mass Flow Controllers
- Leak detection
- Gas flow through the instrument and proper ventilation

Gas line checks
------------------------

It is a requirement for operating this laboratory that gas lines accessible within the lab are checked by a competent person at a minimum every 12 months for leaks and general wear and tear of hoses. A spreadsheet is available within the lab that documents all past gas line checks. This spread sheet should be filled out and signed by a competent person after succesfully checking all gas lines and taking appropriate measures to prevent leaks.

High-temperature warning sign
-----------------------------
A laminated warning sign is available within the lab for use during high-temperature experiments. The furnace and apparatus can get extremely hot during high-temperature operations; however, this fact may no be readily apparent to bystanders or other users of the lab. For this reason, the high-temperature warning sign must always be placed in an obvious location near the furnace to warn people of the potential danger. This sign must remain in place for the duration of the experiment.
