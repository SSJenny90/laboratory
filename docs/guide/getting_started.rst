Getting Started
================

This laboratory is set up to be fully automated and reuire only a basic understanding of programming concepts. Ideally it should happily run an experiment for weeks and months on end without supervision, although it is certainly worth checking in on. Despite it's ease of use, it is strongly advisable to read through this documentation so that you have a good understanding of what is happening so that you may troubleshoot issues when necessary. The following section will outline the options available to you in terms of controlling the instruments and setting up an experiment. 

.. note::

    This program has been written such that the end user requires only minimal programming experience; however, the following basic knowledge will be expected:

    - basic knowledge of Python programming
    - basic uderstanding of virtual environments (specifically pipenv)

    The following will be helpful if you wish to process and visualise data with this program:

    - understanding of Pandas data structures and manipulation
    - familiarity with Matplotlib plotting functions
