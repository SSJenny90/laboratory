Safety Considerations
=====================

There are several safety considerations that MUST be taken into account everytime you use the lab. This page will document the obvious and hopefully some of the not-so-obvious issues, however, all users must adhere to strict rules of common sense when using the laboratory. See the :doc:`SOPs` for instructions on mitigating potential incidents. 


Extreme temperature
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The laboratory is designed to measure the electrical properties of rock samples at very high temperatures. The setup incorporates a furnace that can reach temperatures as high as 1300 degreses Celsius in order to do so. Obviously such high temperatures pose a risk to not only the user, but to others that share the laboratory - even while you are not present. For this reason, it is important to ensure adequate warnings and instructions are in place whenever an experiment is ongoing. See the :doc:`SOPs` for details on how to reduce the risk from high temperature equipment.

Gases
^^^^^
The laboratory utilizes carbon-monoxide (CO), carbon-dioxide (CO2) and hydrogen (H2) in order to simulate the oxygen fugacity conditions found within the Earth's crust. Each gas poses it's own risk which should be kept in mind when setting up and running an experiment. It is not the purpose of this guide to list out the risks of each gas but to make the user aware that there are always risks involved. The :doc:`SOPs` contains more information on how to mitigate the risks; however, if the user wishes to learn more, they are encouraged to read the relevant documents in the laboratory, speak to the laboratory supervisor or seek more information through either `ChemWatch <http://jr.chemwatch.net/chemwatch.web/account/autologin?domain=uniadelaide&login=everyone&password=ndy765Tr45>`_ or, if that link fails, the `HSW page <https://sciences.adelaide.edu.au/intranet/hsw>`_ for the University of Adelaide's Science faculty intranet (login required).

Air-conditioner
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
An air-conditioner is installed in the G28 laboratory directly above where the electrical conductivity laboratory is currently set up. This air-conditioner is crucial to other instruments in the room and must remain on 24/7. It does however pose a significant risk to the both the building and sensitive equipment beneath it should it begin to leak (it has happened before!). Supposedly the unit was fixed for leaks but we were also promised a suspended drip tray as a precaution which has yet to be installed at the time of writing this. If it has been installed, it is worthwhile to make sure it is empty before proceeding with any experiments. It is also recommended to keep electrical equipment and sensitive instruments out of the way as much as possible.

Electrical cables
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The G28 laboratory only has a small amount of electrical outlets within reach of the instruments that make up the conductivity laboratory. As such, a number of power boards have been utilized to accommodate the setup. While these power boards are of high quality, it is important to make sure that they remain off the ground and are not in any position so as to come in to contact with water dripping from the `air-conditioner`_.

Coolant
^^^^^^^
During high temperature experiments, it may be useful or necessary to use the cooling apparatus, which pumps coolant to the outside of the ceramic tube via a series of connecting hose. It is important to ensure all connections are secure before operating the cooling apparatus to so that no leaks occur. Leaks have occurred in the past and do not make for a fun day when discovered.
